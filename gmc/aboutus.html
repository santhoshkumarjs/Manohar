		<h2>ABOUT US</h2>
		<p class="padt20">GMC has "embarked" on a mission to bridge the gap between Theory & Practice. The Value chain comprising of students, institutions and industry needs to be interfaced and brought closer to one another. We aim to "impart" through scientific, online as well as offline based modules for the student community to be employable by brushing and honing their skills. We aim to "enable" the institution across the length & breadth of the state closer to the industry by assisting in pre placement as well as placement activities. We aim to "engage" the industry in identifying the skill sets required across various domains and help in reducing the learning curve for all entry level candidates. A visionary team with experience in IT, Training, Technology, Telecom and entrepreneurial ventures are out to make a statement "Together We Can, Together We Shall" </p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
